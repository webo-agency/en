### **What is Headless CMS?**

::::prose-p3
Websites built in the Headless architecture involve separating the user interface (frontend) from administrative functions and internal resources (backend). Both layers are independent of each other, and communication between them is done through an API. A website built in the Headless architecture enables better website optimization, ultra-fast loading, unlimited website development, while meeting the highest standards of security. When combined with the Wordpress content management system, you gain these advantages while maintaining the functionality and ease of WP content editing.

#### **When is it worth implementing websites based on Headless?**

::::prose-p3
Headless websites have particular value for technology companies and those operating in R&D (research and development). This is due to the specificity of business sectors and exposure to potential external threats. Headless is also suitable for extensive websites that publish content across multiple distribution channels and operate on a large scale, requiring high performance and long-term maintenance cost reduction.

- Reducing the risk of loss of sensitive internal data
- Increasing website accessibility even with a weak connection or offline mode
- Independence of frontend and backend teams working on the website
- Increasing performance and efficiency even with highly complex websites
