##### What does a set package of hours give me?

#description
The package of hours, established as part of the permanent service, is a guarantee of the availability of the time needed for action. Regardless of our workload, every month we set a list of tasks we will perform, and when you have an urgent request you do not have to wait in line - we prioritize implementation.
