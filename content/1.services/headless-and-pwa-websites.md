### What are *Headless and PWA websites?*

#description
::::::prose-p-4

class: mb-10
---
Websites built with **Headless architecture** involve separating the user interface (frontend) from administrative functions and internal resources (backend). Both layers are independent of each other, and communication between them is done through APIs.
::::::
::::::prose-p-4
**PWA (Progressive Web Application)** is a progressive web app, launched just like a regular website. It combines the benefits of traditional websites, such as flexibility and modifiability, with the features of native applications, such as fast performance and offline functionality.
