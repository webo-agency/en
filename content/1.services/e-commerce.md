An online store is often the heart of a business. Imagine that your business is growing, more and more customers are visiting your online store and you need new functions. We think about such situations from the very beginning, from choosing the platform, through preparing the infrastructure, to **designing and programming the store** enabling development.

:::::prose-p-4

We also pay special attention to the stability of the system. We use modern tools to ensure continuity of sales - uninterrupted operation is the basis that directly affects profitability.

#### 30% faster page loading

Which directly affects positioning and, above all, conversion. Google reports show that users abandon the store when it takes more than 4 seconds to load â†’ abandon = they will not buy.

#### Lower marketing costs

The Google algorithm promotes fast and high-quality online stores. The higher the store's rating, the cheaper the cost of clicking on the ad and the higher the position in the search results.

Support cost = number of permanent maintenance tasks per month. The better the store is made, the fewer unexpected events that require an IT team. You can focus on promoting and developing.

### *5/* Stages of implementing an online store

#title
## See how we create *online stores*

:::::
::::

#right
::::effect-appear-md
The number of factors that need to be taken into account when creating online stores is very large. All this to ensure that each element is well thought out and refined. This requires an analysis of assumptions and knowledge in the field of design and programming, and everything should be connected in a refined process that guarantees high quality of workmanship.

#title
#### 01. Requirements analysis

#description
This is the first step we need to take to create an online store. During the first conversation, we thoroughly learn about your needs and project assumptions.

**During this stage:**
- We run video workshops
- We select the best technology and solutions tailored to your project
- We prepare a cost estimate, which includes a detailed implementation method and technology stack
- We determine the project duration and delivery deadlines<br>

**After the cost estimate, proposed solutions, and deadlines are approved, we sign a cooperation agreement and move on to implementation.**

#title
#### 02. UX/UI Design

#description
During this stage we work on the graphic design. We start our work by analyzing the habits of the target group (your customers) and the competition - all in order to create ideal shopping conditions for your customers. Then we develop mood boards (inspiration boards), designate user paths (user flow), design UX mockups, ending with the final appearance of your website.

**During this stage:**
- You will have insight into every stage of the design work and direct contact with an experienced UX/UI designer.
- You will accept individual stages of the implementation of your store's project - from mood boards to the final look.<br>

**Once the final look is approved, the project is ready for the programming stage**

#title
#### 03. Development

#description
After accepting the interface design, we start working on the comprehensive implementation of the online store in the selected technology. We work from configuring the technical infrastructure, through installing the required tools, to fully programming the website.

**During this stage:**
- You will have a live preview of the site in the development environment, which will give you full control over the project
- We will configure the technical infrastructure needed for the efficient operation of the website
- We will develop the website with all the required features and integrations e.g. GA4.<br>

**Once the programming stage is complete, we submit the store for QA.**

#title
#### 04. QA & Publishing

#description
At this stage, we thoroughly check the operation of the online store. We perform tests on many devices and screen resolutions (from the smallest smartphones to FHD displays), all to make sure that all functions work as expected. After passing internal tests, we submit the website for your verification - this is the moment to refine the project and submit any comments before publication.

**During this stage:**
- We check the performance of each function, the performance of the site, infrastructure configurations and the display of the store on multiple devices
- We forward the site to the client for review, make any corrections to prepare the site for publication.<br>

**After receiving the green light for publication from the client, we will kick off!**

#title
#### 05. Maintenance & growth

#description
The publication of the store is just the beginning, while using the store, ideas for new functionalities, tabs and improvements appear - at this point we cannot forget about necessary updates or monitoring performance, security and stability.

**As part of our support service, we handle the following work:**
- Update the environment (system) as part of maintenance
- Monitoring the security and speed of the site
- Design and development of the website
- Designing and implementing new functionalities and dedicated modules
- Responding to potential failures<br>

**Once the scope of support is agreed we begin a long-term relationship**
